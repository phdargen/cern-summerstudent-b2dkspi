selection.cpp: code for LL_11/12/15/16/17/18

LL_11/12: 
	B/D/KsMass.pdf: B/D/K Mass before and after selection, trigger selection:11-12
	bkg.pdf: distribution of the 6 PID variables for signal & combinatorial bkg (B_DTF_MM > 5500)
	eff.txt: efficiency: #events after/ #events before


LL_15-18:
	B/D/KsMass.pdf: B/D/K Mass before and after selection, trigger selection:15-18
	bkg.pdf: distribution of the 6 PID variables for signal & combinatorial bkg (B_DTF_MM > 5500)
	eff.txt: efficiency: #events after/ #events before

LL_MC:
	MCselection.cpp: code
	eff.txt: efficiency: #events after/ #events before
	the MC efficiency is 0.71, implying that the cuts are appropriate.
